DHReSCU is looking for a consultant for the DH project “Autosizer,” a project researching methods for using artificial intelligence to generate computer-readable physical dimensions from existing item images and catalog metadata. Uses multi-modal large language models, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Specifically, aims to generate numeric dimensions for height and width from item images and metadata. 

Below is a list of requirements specific to this project that we are looking for in a potential DH RSE consultant. The estimated total time commitment for this project is around 25 hours spread out over several months. If you think you fit these requirements, please fill out our [consultant application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHRFrmFT0qJvtdSXIJX_90U-mZNTopStYe9myq7ypK0AKAtg/viewform) and send us your resume at dhrescu-contact@googlegroups.com

Qualifications:

- Demonstrated experience working on research software engineering for Digital Humanities Projects
- Extensive Python programming knowledge
- Experience working on humanities research projects
- Ability to design and plan comprehensive technical implementations for research software projects
- Understanding of common research software engineering mistakes and bottlenecks
- Excellent English communication skills
- Experience with Machine Learning, particularly natural language processing, LLMs, and vision models
- Experience with Computer Vision and OpenCV
- Experience working with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)
- Experience working with archives, library collections, and catalogs
- Experience with CI/CD, and automated testing
- Experience with Git

Expectations:

- The consultant will meet with the project team bi-weekly for roughly 30-minutes until the technical implementation plan is delivered.
- The consultant will meet with the DHReSCU team 3 times throughout the consulting period: a project kick-off meeting, a mid-way check-in meeting, and a project wrap-up meeting.
- The consultant will provide feedback on the process.
- Based on the conversations with the project team the consultant is matched with, the consultant will write up a technical implementation plan. The technical implementation plan should be 5 to 10 pages long (depending on the project) and address the main implementation - questions and concerns the project team communicates to the consultant.
- The consultant should be prepared to review the project's technical architecture, assess specific technical implementation choices (tools, languages, methods), suggest alternative approaches, offer cautionary advice, and help establish realistic development timelines.

Compensation:
A stipend of $2300 will be paid upon delivering the technical implementation plan.
