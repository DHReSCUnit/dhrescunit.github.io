**We are excited to open project applications for DHReSCU. If you have a Digital Humanities Research Project and are looking for consultation, submit your project [using this application form](https://forms.gle/Hxuj7bXe7nsGxNg4A) by ~~November 27th~~ December 31st.**

DHReSCU is a pilot program meant to aid early-stage digital humanities research software projects in developing a technical implementation plan. We hope to connect experienced research software engineers with digital humanities projects. The resulting technical implementation plan is meant to reduce mistakes made and improve project outcomes.

Since DHReSCU is in a pilot phase, itâ€™s important for us to understand the needs of DH projects for this kind of consulting. **Even if you don't think your project is a good candidate for us: please still apply.** We are interested in your feedback and comments. This is valuable information to us as we evaluate the role and feasibility of DHReSCU.

**Selected Project teams will be compensated with a stipend of $1500 for their time in this process.**
