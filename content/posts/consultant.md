**We are excited to open consultant applications for DHReSCU. If you are a Research Software Engineer and would like to consult on projects in need, apply to be a consultant [using this application form](https://forms.gle/xzL6D8t53EmynCYW7).**

DHReSCU is a pilot program meant to aid early-stage digital humanities research software projects in developing a technical implementation plan. We hope to connect experienced research software engineers with digital humanities projects. The resulting technical implementation plan is meant to reduce mistakes made and improve project outcomes.

**Selected consultants will be compensated with a stipend of $2200 for their time in this process.**
