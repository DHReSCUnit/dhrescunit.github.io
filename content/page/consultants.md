DHReSCU is a pilot program meant to aid early-stage digital humanities research software projects in developing a technical implementation plan. We hope to connect experienced research software engineers with digital humanities projects. The resulting technical implementation plan is meant to reduce mistakes made and improve project outcomes.

To this end, we are looking for DH research software engineering consultants to partner with DHReSCU. These consultants are paid a stipend of $2300 for meeting with their assigned project team and creating a technical implementation plan.

If you are interested in consulting for a DHReSCU Project, see our partnered projects [here](/page/projects).
