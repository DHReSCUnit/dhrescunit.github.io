DHReSCU is partnered with the following DH projects:

“AsteXT,” a project designed around building a database for Asian American short stories published between 1974 and 2024. This project aims to develop a text analysis NLP toolkit designed specifically for short-form fictional writing and to find quantitative linguistic trends in Asian American short stories.

“Autosizer,” a project researching methods for using artificial intelligence to generate computer-readable physical dimensions from existing item images and catalog metadata. This project uses multi-modal large language models, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Specifically, it aims to generate numeric dimensions for height and width from item images and metadata.
